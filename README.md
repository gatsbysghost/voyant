# Voyant Coding Exercise

## Common Passwords Check

## Weather
*Note*: Before running this application, you must first set the environment variable OWM\_API\_KEY to a valid OpenWeatherMap API key. I have provided one for test purposes. On a linux/unix/macOS system, you can set this environment variable using the following command in your shell:

`export OWM_API_KEY='d94aa5248e7ecf2be851189a6e3ad9af'

Afterwards, the program may be executed in its local directory by running `python3 weather.py \[ZIP\]`, where `\[ZIP\]` is a valid 5-digit US ZIP code.
